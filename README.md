# XAI-VPE
This project introduces a Variational Prototyping Encoder (VPE) that classifies unseen handwritten digits by learning visual concepts like circularity and loopiness. Blending zero-shot learning with interpretable latent spaces and concept-based explanations, it pushes generative models toward more human-aligned understanding
